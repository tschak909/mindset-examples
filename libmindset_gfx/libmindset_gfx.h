/**
 * Function: Enables or disables the use of genlock for transparent colors,
 * enables or disables interlaced sync display, and enables or
 * disables fixed-phase display.
 * 
 * Description: The SET DISPLAY SYNC FEATURES command performs three distinct
 * but related functions: enabling genlock, enabling interlaced
 * sync display, and enabling fixed-phase display. Enabling genlock makes certain colors transparent so that an external video
 * signal can show through.
 * 
 * Normally, the Mindset computer provides its own sync signal for
 * video operation (internal video synchronization is the default).
 * Using genlock, the Mindset computer can alternatÂ·ively synchronize its output with the output from another video device such
 * as a camera or video tape recorder. The genlock enable bit
 * determines whether the Mindset computer provides its sync signal
 * independently or matches its sync signal with the sync signal of
 * an external device.
 * 
 * Genlock is normally disabled. When the user enables genlock, it
 * affects only the colors that do not have the key bit set within
 * their color palette definition; enabling genlock makes these
 * colors transparent. This feature is most useful for making the
 * background transparent so that an external video signal provides
 * the background.
 * 
 * The interlaced sync display is normally disabled. Enabled, this
 * feature uses 200 lines of display data, but displays data with
 * an interlaced sync using 400 scan lines. Using an even/odd scan
 * line pair to display each row of pixels creates a more filled-in
 * look on the display.
 * 
 * Fixed-phase synchronization, when enabled, provides more flexibility in pixel-by-pixel color mixing and prevents flashing on
 * the display. However, it also changes the television display so
 * that some pictures may appear distorted.

/**
 * Set Display Interrupt
 * Specifies the scan line at which the display processor causes
 * the CPU to perform a user-defined interrupt service routine.
 * This command also enables and disables a diagnostic marker that
 * appears on the specified scan line.
 * Description: The SET DISPLAY INTERRUPT command enables the user to synchronize animation with the drawing of the screen by the display
 * processor. This command controls a marker to assist the user in
 * tracing the operation of the display interrupt. This diagnostic
 * Input
 * j marker is a horizontal line that appears on the scan line that
 * triggers the display interrupt.
 * The display interrupt operates only in the graphics mode of the
 * Mindset computer.
 * 
 * A scan line is comprised of a row of pixels. The top scan line
 * on the screen is line 0 and the bottom scan line is line 199.
 * In interlaced graphics modes, the bottom scan line is effectively the 398th (on even line passes) or 399th (on odd line
 * passes) line displayed, but is still referred to as line 199 in
 * this command because it is the 199th line scanned on each pass.
 * If the user does not define a scan line with the SET DISPLAY
 * INTERRUPT command, the system uses line 199 as the default scan
 * line for calling the user-defined interrupt routine.
 * Use the SET DISPLAY INT ADDRESS command to specify the address
 * of the user-defined service routine (see "Graphics Coprocessor
 * Operation" later in this section). The default value for this
 * vector is zero. If the vector is zero, the system does not call
 * a user-defined interrupt service routine. ':'(
 * 
 * line - Scanline to trigger display interrupt (0-199)
 * marker - enable/disable diagnostic marker for display interrupt line
